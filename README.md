# Team Management Tool

## Overview
The Team Management Tool is designed to streamline project management by leveraging Agile principles and Azure DevOps features. It provides capabilities for user authentication, task management, real-time updates, progress reporting, and notifications. The tool facilitates collaboration and ensures project delivery with automated CI/CD pipelines and telemetry integration.

## Objectives
- Simplify project management by enabling task creation, assignment, and tracking.
- Enhance team collaboration using Azure DevOps tools.
- Provide actionable insights through progress reporting and telemetry.
- Automate the build and deployment process to reduce manual effort.

## Scope
The project is divided into two parts:
- **Part A: Agile Development**
  - Develop user stories, a prioritized requirements list, and a product backlog.
  - Plan and execute sprints, conduct daily scrum meetings, and review sprints.
- **Part B: Azure DevOps Implementation**
  - Set up a project in Azure DevOps, manage the backlog, and use CI/CD pipelines.
  - Utilize telemetry and extensions to monitor and improve application performance.

## Requirements

### Part A: Agile Development
1. **User Stories**:
   - **US001**: As a user, I want to register and log in to the system to access tasks securely.
   - **US002**: As a project manager, I want to create and assign tasks to team members.
   - **US003**: As a team member, I want to view and update task statuses in real-time.
   - **US004**: As a project manager, I want to generate progress reports to track the timeline.
   - **US005**: As a user, I want to receive notifications for task updates.

2. **Prioritized Requirements List (PRL)**:
   - **High Priority**: User authentication (US001), Task management (US002).
   - **Medium Priority**: Task updates (US003), Progress reports (US004).
   - **Low Priority**: Notifications (US005).

3. **Product Backlog**:
   - Implement a login system.
   - Create a task assignment module.
   - Design task status and reporting features.
   - Integrate notification functionality.

4. **Sprint Planning**:
   - **Sprint 1**: Develop user authentication and basic task management.
   - **Sprint 2**: Build task status updates and progress reporting.
   - **Sprint 3**: Implement notifications and finalize testing.

5. **Daily Scrum**:
   - Document progress, blockers, and plans for each day.

6. **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**:
   - Review deliverables at the end of each sprint.
   - Reflect on successes and areas for improvement.

### Part B: Azure DevOps Implementation
1. **Azure DevOps Project**:
   - Create and configure a new project.
   - Add team members for collaboration.

2. **Backlog Management**:
   - Translate user stories into work items.
   - Prioritize and assign tasks to sprints.

3. **Repos**:
   - Set up version control for source code.
   - Maintain a clean and organized structure.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Configure build pipelines for code compilation and testing.
   - Set up release pipelines for deployment.

5. **Extensions and Telemetry**:
   - Install necessary Azure DevOps extensions for productivity.
   - Use Application Insights for performance tracking.

6. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Provide screenshots, code snippets, and a step-by-step guide.

## Deliverables
- **Part A**:
  - Agile development document with user stories, backlog, and sprint plans.
- **Part B**:
  - Functional application with source code.
  - Configured CI/CD pipelines.
  - Technical documentation and performance telemetry.
- **Final Demonstration**:
  - Present backlog management, pipeline workflows, and telemetry insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Azure DevOps**: Backlog, Repos, Pipelines, Extensions.
- **Application Insights**: Telemetry and performance tracking.
- **Programming Languages**: Depends on project implementation (e.g., Java, Python).

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Define user stories and backlog.
- **Week 2**: Sprint 1 execution and review.
- **Week 3**: Sprint 2 execution and review.
- **Week 4**: Sprint 3 execution and final testing.
- **Week 5**: Final demonstration and documentation submission.
